"""Health checks provide a way for the hoster to check if the application is
still running and working as expected.

The most basic health check is enabled by default on the */_system/check*
route. This is a very simple check if the process is running and provides no
details to your application checks.

To demonstrate the idea we will describe a simple health check perfoming a
request to a HTTP resource and return the appropriate result::

    @s.provides(s.MediaType.ApplicationJson, default=True)
    class SimpleHttpResourceCheck(s.RequestHandler):

        @s.async
        def get(self):
            result = self.environment.http_resource.ping()
            if result.code == 200:
                raise s.HealthCheckOk()
            if result.code == 599:
                raise s.HealthCheckError()

To enable this health check simply add this to the environment in your services
run method::

    class MyService(s.Service):

        def run(self):
            self.environment.add_health_check('http_resource',
                                              SimpleHttpResourceCheck)

When the service is then started you can access the check as
*/_system/check/http_resource*::

    $ curl 'http://127.0.0.1/_system/check/http_resource'
    {"code": "OK", "ok": true}

The HTTP response code will be **200** when everything is ok. Any error,
**WARNING** or **ERROR** will return the HTTP code **500**. A warning will
return the response::

    $ curl 'http://127.0.0.1/_system/check/http_resource_with_warning'
    {"code": "WARNING", "error": true}

and an error a similar one::

    $ curl 'http://127.0.0.1/_system/check/http_resource_with_warning'
    {"code": "ERROR", "error": true}
